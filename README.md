# PancakeArtbot

Hello and welcome to the Sierra College Robotics Club Painting Artbot team
The goal of this project is to create a robot related to art and painting.  Our idea is to design a pancake bot that dispenses batter onto a hot griddle. The user control the x and y axis using a pen tablet which is translated into controlling the stepper motor direction and steps.
